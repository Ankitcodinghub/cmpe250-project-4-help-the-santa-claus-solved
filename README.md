1 Introduction

<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
Hi, there! Firstly, thank you all in advance for helping me on distributing the gifts. But it wonâ€™t be that straightforward because I have various gifts to distribute to different regions. I will explain the properties of gifts and how we will distribute them. Santa Claus Expresses and Santa Clausâ€™s reindeers will help us but unfortunately, they can carry gifts as much as their capacities. Therefore, in some cases, it will be impossible to deliver all gifts to their owners. At this point, I need your help. Can you help me to figure out the minimum number of gifts that canâ€™t be delivered?

2 Details

There are two kinds of regions, which we call the green region and the red region. Therefore, trains and reindeers can be classified as those going to the green region and the red region.

Our gifts are in the bags, and we should distribute them to trains and reindeers according to the properties of the bag. You can consider that the same type of gifts is in the same bag, and we want to distribute them properly.

Properties of bags are as follow, remark that one bag has more than one property

a. Each of the gifts in this bag type should be distributed through different vehicles, i.e. there are no 2 gifts from the same bag on the same train or reindeer.

b. Each of the gifts in this bag type should only be distributed to green regions. c. Each of the gifts in this bag type should only be distributed to red regions. d. Each of the gifts in this bag type should only be distributed by train.

e. Each of the gifts in this bag type should only be distributed by reindeer.

If itâ€™s not specified, assume that gifts can be distributed to all regions, and both by train and reindeer.

Letâ€™s look at some examples of bag types.

o bd can be distributed only by trains which go to green regions

o ace can be distributed only by reindeers which go to red regions and there are

no 2 gifts from this bag on the same reindeer

only constraint is that there are no 2 gifts from this bag on the same vehicle invalid, it wonâ€™t be given as an input to you because it is a contradictory invalid, it wonâ€™t be given as an input to you because it is a contradictory
